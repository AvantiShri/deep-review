## Discussion

*This section provides meta-commentary that spans the Categorize, Study, and
Treat subject areas.  The candidate sub-sections below are initial ideas that
can be further pruned.*

### Evaluation

*What are the challenges in evaluating deep learning models that are specific to
this domain?  This can include a discussion of ROC versus precision-recall
curves for the imbalanced classes often encountered in biomedical datasets.
It could also mention alternative metrics that are used in specific sub-areas
such as enrichment factors in virtual screening.  A lack of true gold standard
data for some problems complicates both training and evaluation.  Confidence-
weighted labels are valuable when available.*

*Is progress in some biomedical areas slowed when new predictions (e.g. from
generative models) cannot be assessed by any human expert and require
experimental testing?  For example, contrast a painting or song generated by
a GAN versus a novel chemical compound.  Related is the idea that on some tasks
(e.g. the recent wave of deep learning versus MD image classification papers)
it is easy to tell when deep learning has produced a breakthrough because
human-level performance is an impressive baseline.  In many tasks we reviewed,
human-level performance is irrelevant.*

### Interpretation

Approaches for understanding the patterns learned by deep learning models can be
broadly divided into: sample-specific importance scoring, visualization 

Sample-specific importance scoring and interpretation:
- perturbation-based approaches where you observe the impact of the output on
perturbed versions of the input and use that to ascribe importance. Simplest
version is forward propagations (ISM, basset=filter nullification). LIME builds
a linear model to approximate the output on the perturbed input and uses this
to ascribe feature importance. Prediction difference analysis uses conditional
probability to intelligently sample the perturbations. These approaches are
computationally expensive (copy whatever the 'meaningful perturbations' paper
said about LIME). The meaningful perturbations paper uses gradient descent
to identify which portion of an image to blur, thereby alleviating but not completely
eliminating the computational burden.
- backpropagation approaches to alleviate computational burden. Simonyan,
LRP which is gradient*input, guided backprop (kicks out negative gradients),
guided grad CAM (where class specificity only comes from the feature-map layer).
As noted by [deeplift, integrated gradients paper], several of these methods
that rely on variants of computing gradients are susceptible to saturation
effects. This can be addressed use a reference, such as deeplift
and integrated gradients (left limit of integral).
DeepLIFT is computationally more efficient than integrated
gradients and can optionally support separating positive and negative
contributions which can improve attribution scores under certain circumstances,
while integrated gradients, being a fully black-box method in that it is
agnostic to the details of the model architecture, has stronger theoretical
guarantees in that it will always give the same output for functionally
equivalent models. Optimal choice of reference is an open question. 
- 'inversion' - stay faithful to the hidden layer representations. natural
images in the Mahendran paper. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-016-0911-8,
then there is the entropy paper ("Maximum Entropy Methods for Extracting the Learned Features of Deep Neural Networks") where find the maximum entropy representation of a sequence that maintains the hidden activation.

Visualizatinon:
- Understanding neural networks through deep visualization
- Mahendran and Vedaldi; mention it gives aggregate picture but not for individual filters
- DeepMotif
- ActiVis

RNN visualization:
- Attention mechanism...Other studies have
primarily focused on integrating attention mechanisms with the neural networks.
Attention mechanisms dynamically weight the importance the neural network gives
to each feature. By inspecting the attention weights for a particular sample, a
practitioner can identify the important features for a particular prediction.
Choi et al [@tag:Choi2016_retain] inverted the typical architecture of recurrent
neural networks to improve interpretability. In particular, they only used
recurrent connections in the attention generating procedure, leaving the hidden
state directly connected to the input variables. In the clinical domain, this
model was able to produce accurate diagnoses in which the contribution of
previous hospital visits could be directly interpreted. Choi et al
[@tag:Choi2016_gram] later extended this work to take into account the structure
of disease ontologies and found that the concepts represented by the model were
aligned with medical knowledge.

Condense to a simpler model altogether via distillation: Che et al [@tag:Che2015_distill] introduced a
knowledge-distillation approach which used gradient boosted trees to learn
interpretable healthcare features from trained deep models.

Interpretability matters, among other things, because deep networks are easily fooled
[@tag:Nguyen2014_adversarial]. 

Toward quantifying the uncertainty of
predictions, there has been a renewed interest in confidence intervals for
deep neural networks. Early work from Chryssolouris et al
[@tag:Chryssolouris1996_confidence] provided confidence intervals under the
 assumption of normally distributed error. Test-time dropout can also be
used to obtain a probabilistic interpretation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142



### Data limitations

*Related to evaluation, are there data quality issues in genomic, clinical, and
other data that make this domain particularly challenging?  Are these worse than
what is faced in other non-biomedical domains?*

*Many applications have used relatively small training datasets.  We might
discuss workarounds (e.g. semi-synthetic data, splitting instances, etc.) and
how this could impact future progress.  Might this be why some studies have
resorted to feature engineering instead of learning representations from low-
level features?  Is there still work to be done in finding the right low-level
features in some problems?*

###### Biomedical data is often "Wide"

*Biomedical studies typically deal with relatively small sample sizes but each
sample may have millions of measurements (genotypes and other omics data, lab
tests etc).*

*Classical machine learning recommendations were to have 10x samples per number
of parameters in the model.*

*Number of parameters in an MLP. Convolutions and similar strategies help but do
not solve*

*Bengio diet networks paper*


### Hardware limitations and scaling

*Several papers have stated that memory or other hardware limitations
artificially restricted the number of training instances, model inputs/outputs,
hidden layers, etc.  Is this a general problem worth discussing or will it be
solved naturally as hardware improves and/or groups move to distributed deep
learning frameworks?  Does hardware limit what types of problems are accessible
to the average computational group, and if so, will that limit future progress?
For instance, some hyperparameter search strategies are not feasible for a lab
with only a couple GPUs.*

*Some of this is also outlined in the Categorize section.  We can decide where
it best fits.*

Efficiently scaling deep learning is challenging, and there is a high
computational cost (e.g., time, memory, energy) associated with training neural
networks and using them for classification. As such, neural networks
have only recently found widespread use [@tag:Schmidhuber2014_dnn_overview].

Many have sought to curb the costs of deep learning, with methods ranging from
the very applied (e.g., reduced numerical precision [@tag:Gupta2015_prec
@tag:Bengio2015_prec @tag:Sa2015_buckwild @tag:Hubara2016_qnn]) to the exotic
and theoretic (e.g., training small networks to mimic large networks and
ensembles [@tag:Caruana2014_need @tag:Hinton2015_dark_knowledge]). The largest
gains in efficiency have come from computation with graphics processing units
(GPUs) [@tag:Raina2009_gpu @tag:Vanhoucke2011_cpu @tag:Seide2014_parallel
@tag:Hadjas2015_cc @tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains
@tag:Schmidhuber2014_dnn_overview], which excel at the matrix and vector
operations so central to deep learning. The massively parallel nature of GPUs
allows additional optimizations, such as accelerated mini-batch gradient
descent [@tag:Vanhoucke2011_cpu @tag:Seide2014_parallel @tag:Su2015_gpu
@tag:Li2014_minibatch]. However, GPUs also have a limited quantity of memory,
making it difficult to implement networks of significant size and
complexity on a single GPU or machine [@tag:Raina2009_gpu
@tag:Krizhevsky2013_nips_cnn]. This restriction has sometimes forced
computational biologists to use workarounds or limit the size of an analysis.
For example, Chen et al. [@tag:Chen2016_gene_expr] aimed to infer the
expression level of all genes with a single neural network, but due to
memory restrictions they randomly partitioned genes into two halves and
analyzed each separately. In other cases, researchers limited the size
of their neural network [@tag:Wang2016_protein_contact
@tag:Gomezb2016_automatic]. Some have also chosen to use slower
CPU implementations rather than sacrifice network size or performance
[@tag:Yasushi2016_cgbvs_dnn].

Steady improvements in GPU hardware may alleviate this issue somewhat, but it
is not clear whether they can occur quickly enough to keep up with the growing
amount of available biological data or increasing network sizes. Much has
been done to minimize the memory
requirements of neural networks [@tag:CudNN @tag:Caruana2014_need
@tag:Gupta2015_prec @tag:Bengio2015_prec @tag:Sa2015_buckwild
@tag:Chen2015_hashing @tag:Hubara2016_qnn], but there is also growing
interest in specialized hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs) [@tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains @tag:Lacey2016_dl_fpga] and
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Specialized hardware promises
improvements in deep learning at reduced time, energy, and memory
[@tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains]. Logically, there is less software for highly
specialized hardware [@tag:Lacey2016_dl_fpga], and it could be a difficult
investment for those not solely interested in deep learning. However, it is
likely that such options will find increased support as they become a more
popular platform for deep learning and general computation.

Distributed computing is a general solution to intense computational
requirements, and has enabled many large-scale deep learning efforts. Early
approaches to distributed computation [@tag:Mapreduce @tag:Graphlab] were
not suitable for deep learning [@tag:Dean2012_nips_downpour],
but significant progress has been made. There
now exist a number of algorithms [@tag:Dean2012_nips_downpour @tag:Dogwild
@tag:Sa2015_buckwild], tools [@tag:Moritz2015_sparknet @tag:Meng2016_mllib
@tag:TensorFlow], and high-level libraries [@tag:Keras @tag:Elephas] for deep
learning in a distributed environment, and it is possible to train very complex
networks with limited infrastructure [@tag:Coates2013_cots_hpc]. Besides
handling very large networks, distributed or parallelized approaches offer
other advantages, such as improved ensembling [@tag:Sun2016_ensemble] or
accelerated hyperparameter optimization [@tag:Bergstra2011_hyper
@tag:Bergstra2012_random].

Cloud computing, which has already seen adoption in genomics
[@tag:Schatz2010_dna_cloud], could facilitate easier sharing of the large
datasets common to biology [@tag:Gerstein2016_scaling @tag:Stein2010_cloud],
and may be key to scaling deep learning. Cloud computing affords researchers
significant flexibility, and enables the use of specialized hardware (e.g.,
FPGAs, ASICs, GPUs) without significant investment. With such flexibility, it
could be easier to address the different challenges associated with the
multitudinous layers and architectures available
[@tag:Krizhevsky2014_weird_trick]. Though many are reluctant to store sensitive
data (e.g., patient electronic health records) in the cloud,
secure/regulation-compliant cloud services do exist [@tag:RAD2010_view_cc].

*TODO: Write the transition once more of the Discussion section has been
fleshed out.*

### Code, data, and model sharing

*Reproducibiliy is important for science to progress. In the context of deep
learning applied to advance human healthcare, does reproducibility have
different requirements or alternative connotations? With vast hyperparameter
spaces, massively heterogeneous and noisy biological data sets, and black box
interpretability problems, how can we best ensure reproducible models? What
might a clinician, or policy maker, need to see in a deep model in order to
influence healthcare decisions? Or, is deep learning a hypothesis generation
machine that requires manual validation? DeepChem and DragoNN are worth
discussing here.*
